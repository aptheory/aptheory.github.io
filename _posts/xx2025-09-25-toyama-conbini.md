### Abstract

### Introduction
I spend about 3 months internship in Institute of Natural Medicine, University of Toyama, Japan. And I came across so many good items in Konbini (コンビニ) that I would like to share.

- Here's the thing about me:
    > I prefer light, or bland flavor food. For example, I prefer Udon over Ramen because of Udon's lighter broth
    
    > I crave for PROTEIN ! 
    
    > I don't eat sweets like cake but prefer Ice Latte over black coffee

### Protein and where to find them 
I usually scan the nutrition fact for　「蛋白質」　or 「タンパク質」, it means *protein* in Japanese.

|JP Name | En Name | Description |
|-|-|-|
|SAVAS Milk Protein||Quite famous protein drink that you could find in Japan. Their drink can range from 15g to 30g of protein, and they offer many flavours.|
|OIKOS プロテインドリンク|OIKOS Protein Drink|My favourite protein drink as the package claimed that they used easily absorbed protein and they have 0 added sugar. The price is particularly higher than SAVAS.|
|OIKOS Yoghurt||This brand also offer high protein yoghurt|

### Sweets
I don't like sweets but if I have to pick one (we all need a bit of snack aftermeal, desho?), I usually pick one with lowest calories in the shelf:

|JP Name | En Name | Description |
|-|-|-|
|ふんわりワッフル|[Lawson] Soft Waffle|A very light and soft waffle with mild sweet cream inside, less than 200kcal for 162円|
|「お月見」ダブルカスタードクリーム|[7-11] Double Custard Cream|I think, this custard is limited time only during お月見 festival (late September), it's quite high in calories but it was good|

### Drinks
- Sugar in Japanese is　砂糖「さとう」. Drinks with no sugar usually written as 無糖「むとう」
- If you like drinking milk and sweet coffee like me, you probably like these:

|JP Name | En Name | Description |
|-|-|-|
|Coffee Lab Latte||This is perfect. Not too milky or too sweet latte in a PET bottle.|
|Demitasse 甘いさに頼らないLatte||The drink title literally means *the Latte that does not rely on sweetness*. It's sweeter than Tully's.|
|Tully's Coffee 無糖 Latte||無糖 means no sugar, so it's a latte with only has sweetness from milk|
