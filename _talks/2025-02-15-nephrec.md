Delighted to show our groundbreaking work on the future of Traditional Thai Medicine (TTM) through AI innovation at the NEPhReC 2025! Our project, AppHerb: Language Model for Recommending TTM ✨⚡️

Had a great time meeting many TTM and AI enthusiasts. Receiving feedback from you helps us a lot in the next stage of AppHerb development 👀

Special shoutout to my fantastic advisors, Ajarn Tarapong Srisongkram and Ajarn Suppachai Tiyaworanant - your guidance and collaboration made this possible!
