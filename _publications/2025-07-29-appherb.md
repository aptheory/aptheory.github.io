**Abstract:** Trust in Traditional Thai Medicine (TTM) among Thai people has been reduced due to a lack of objective standards and the susceptibility of the general population to false information. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) has significantly impacted various industries, including traditional medicine. However, previous Gen AI models have primarily focused on prescription generation based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), leaving TTM unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel fast-learning fine-tuned language model fortified with TTM knowledge. We utilized textual data from two TTM textbooks, Wat Ratcha-orasaram Ratchaworawihan (WRO), and Tamra Osot Phra Narai (NR), to fine-tune Unsloth’s Gemma-2 with 9 billion parameters. We developed two specialized TTM tasks: treatment prediction (TrP) and herbal recipe generation (HRG). The TrP and HRG models achieved precision, recall, and F1 scores of 26.54%, 28.14%, and 24.00%, and 32.51%, 24.42%, and 24.84%, respectively. Performance evaluation against TCM-based generative models showed comparable precision, recall, and F1 results with a smaller knowledge corpus. We further addressed the challenges of utilizing Thai, a low-resource and linguistically complex language. Unlike English or Chinese, Thai lacks explicit sentence boundary markers and employs an abugida writing system without spaces between words, complicating text segmentation and generation. These characteristics pose significant difficulties for machine understanding and limit model accuracy. Despite these obstacles, our work establishes a foundation for further development of AI-assisted TTM applications and highlights both the opportunities and challenges in applying language models to traditional medicine knowledge systems in Thai language contexts.
